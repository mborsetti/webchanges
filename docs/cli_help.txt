Checks web content, including images, to detect any changes since the prior
run. If any are found, it summarizes (including with Gen AI) what changed
('diff') and displays it and/or sends it via email and/or other supported
services. Can check the output of local commands as well.

positional arguments:
  JOB(S)                JOB(S) to run (if one, index as per --list or
                        URL/command, if multiple, by index) (default: run all
                        jobs)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose         show logging output; use -vv for maximum verbosity

override file defaults:
  --jobs FILE, --urls FILE
                        read job list (URLs/commands) from FILE or files
                        matching a glob pattern
  --config FILE         read configuration from FILE
  --hooks FILE          use FILE as hooks.py module to import
  --database FILE, --cache FILE
                        use FILE as snapshots database; FILE can be a redis
                        URI

  --errors [REPORTER]   test run all jobs and list those with errors or no

  --test [JOB], --test-filter [JOB]
                        test a JOB (by index or URL/command) and show filtered
                        output; if no JOB, check syntax of config and jobs
                        file(s)
  --no-headless         turn off browser headless mode (for jobs using a
                        browser)
  --test-differ JOB [JOB ...], --test-diff JOB [JOB ...], --test-diff-filter JOB [JOB ...]
                        show diff(s) using existing saved snapshots of a JOB
                        (by index or URL/command)
  --dump-history JOB    print all saved changed snapshots for a JOB (by index
                        or URL/command)
  --max-workers WORKERS
                        maximum number of parallel threads (WORKERS)
