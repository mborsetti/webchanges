.. **** IMPORTANT ****
   All code-block:: yaml in here are automatically tested. As such, each example needs to have a unique URL.
   This URL also needs to be added to the file tests/data/docs_filters_test.py along with the "before" and "after" data
   that will be used for testing.
   This ensures that all examples work now and in the future.
   Please keep code_block line length to 106 to avoid horizontal scrolling lines.

.. _filters:

=======
Filters
=======
Filters can be applied at either of two stages of processing:

* Applied to the downloaded data before storing it and diffing for changes (``filter``).
* Applied to the diff result before reporting the changes (``diff_filter``).

While creating your job pipeline, you might want to preview what the filtered output looks like. For filters applied
to the data, you can run :program:`webchanges` with the ``--test-filter`` command-line option, passing in the index
(from ``--list``) or the URL/command of the job to be tested::

   webchanges --test 1   # Test the first job in the jobs list and show the data collected after it's filtered
   webchanges --test https://example.net/  # Test the job that matches the given URL
   webchanges --test -1  # Test the last job in the jobs list

This command will show the output that will be captured, stored, and used for the comparison to the old version stored
from a previous run against the same url or command.

Once :program:`webchanges` has collected at least 2 historic snapshots of a job (e.g. two different states of a webpage)
you can start testing the effects of your ``diff_filter`` with the command-line option ``--test-differ``, passing in the
index (from ``--list``) or the URL/command of the job to be tested::

   webchanges --test-differ 1    # Test the first job in the jobs list and show the report
   webchanges --test-differ -2   # Test the second-to-last job in the jobs list and show the report

At the moment, the following filters are available:

.. To convert the "webchanges --features" output, use:
   webchanges --features | sed -e 's/^  \* \(.*\) - \(.*\)$/- **\1**: \2/'

.. _absolute_links:

absolute_links
--------------
Convert relative URLs of all ``action``, ``href` and ``src`` attribute in any HTML tag, as well the ``data``
attribute of the ``<object>`` tag, to absolute ones.

.. note:: This filter is not needed (and could interfere) if you already are using the :ref:`beautify` filter (which has
   an ``absolute_links`` sub-directive that defaults to true) or the :ref:`html2text` filter (which already converts
   relative links).

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/absolute_links.html
   filters:
     - absolute_links


.. versionadded:: 3.16

.. versionchanged:: 3.21
   Converts URLs of all ``action``, ``href`` and ``src`` attributes found in any tag as well the ``data`` attribute
   of the ``<object>`` tag.



.. _ascii85:

ascii85
-------
Encodes binary data (e.g. image data) to text using `Ascii85 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ascii85>`__. Ascii85 is
more space-efficient than Base64, encoding more bytes into fewer characters. This filter can be useful to monitor
images in combination with the :ref:`image_diff` differ.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/favicon_85.ico
   filters:
     - ascii85

.. versionadded:: 3.21



.. _base64:

base64
------
Encodes binary data (e.g. image data) to text using `RFC 4648 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648.html>`__
`Base64 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64>`__. This filter can be useful to monitor images in combination with
the :ref:`image_diff` differ.  Also see :ref:`ascii85`, which is more efficient.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/favicon.ico
   filters:
     - base64

.. versionadded:: 3.16



.. _beautify:

beautify
--------
This filter uses the `Beautiful Soup <https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__, `jsbeautifier
<https://pypi.org/project/jsbeautifier/>`__ and `cssbeautifier <https://pypi.org/project/cssbeautifier/>`__ Python
packages to reformat the HTML in a document to make it more readable (keeping it as HTML).

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/beautify.html
   filters:
     - beautify: 1

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``absolute_links`` (true/false): Convert relative links to absolute ones (default: true).
* ``indent`` (integer or string): If indent is a non-negative integer or string, then the contents of HTML elements will
  be indented appropriately when pretty-printing them. An indent level of 0, negative, or "" will only insert newlines.
  Using a positive integer indent indents that many spaces per level. If indent is a string (such as "\t"), that
  string is used to indent each level (default: ``1``, i.e. indent one space per level).

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/beautify_absolute_links_false.html
   filters:
     - beautify:
         absolute_links: false
         indent: 1


.. versionchanged:: 3.16
   Relative links are converted to absolute ones; use the ``absolute_links: false`` sub-directive to disable.

.. versionchanged:: 3.16
   Added ``absolute_links`` sub-directive.

.. versionchanged:: 3.9.2
   Added ``indent`` sub-directive.

Required packages
`````````````````
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[beautify]



.. _css-and-xpath:

css and xpath
-------------
The ``css`` filter extracts HTML or XML content based on a `CSS selector <https://www.w3.org/TR/selectors/>`__. It uses
the `cssselect <https://pypi.org/project/cssselect/>`__ Python package, which has limitations and extensions as
explained in its `documentation <https://cssselect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#supported-selectors>`__.

The ``xpath`` filter extracts HTML or XML content based on a `XPath <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath>`__ version
1.0 expression.

Examples: to filter only the ``<body>`` element of the HTML document, stripping out everything else:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/css.html
   filters:
     - css: ul#groceries > li.unchecked

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/xpath.html
   filters:
     - xpath: /html/body/marquee

.. tip:: If you are looking at a website using Google Chrome, you can find the XPath of an HTML node in DevTools
   (Ctrl+Shift+I) by right clicking on the element and selecting 'Copy -> Copy XPath', or its css by selecting 'Copy
   -> Copy selector'. You can learn more about Chrome DevTools `here <https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/>`__.

See Microsoft’s `XPath Examples
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/dotnet/netframework-4.0/ms256086(v=vs.100)>`__ page for
additional information on XPath.

Using CSS and XPath filters with XML
````````````````````````````````````
By default, CSS and XPath filters are set up for HTML documents, but they also work on XML documents by declaring the
sub-directive ``method: xml``.

For example, to parse an RSS feed and filter only the titles and publication dates, use:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/blog/css-index.rss
   filters:
     - css:
         method: xml
         selector: 'item > title, item > pubDate'
     - html2text: strip_tags

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/blog/xpath-index.rss
   filters:
     - xpath:
         method: xml
         path: '//item/title/text()|//item/pubDate/text()'

To match an element in an `XML namespace <https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names/>`__, use a namespace prefix before the tag
name. Use a ``|`` to separate the namespace prefix and the tag name in a CSS selector, and use a ``:`` in an XPath
expression.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/feed/css-namespace.xml
   filters:
     - css:
         method: xml
         selector: 'item > media|keywords'
         namespaces:
           media: http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/
     - html2text:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/feed/xpath-namespace.xml
   filters:
     - xpath:
         method: xml
         path: '//item/media:keywords/text()'
         namespaces:
           media: http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/

Alternatively, use the XPath expression ``//*[name()='<tag_name>']`` to bypass the namespace entirely.

Using CSS and XPath filters to exclude content
``````````````````````````````````````````````
Elements selected by the ``exclude`` sub-directive are removed from the final result. For example, the following job
will not have any ``<a>`` tag in its results:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/css-exclude.html
   filters:
     - css:
         selector: 'body'
         exclude: 'a'

Limiting the returned items from a CSS Selector or XPath
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
If you only want to return a subset of the items returned by a CSS selector or XPath filter, you can use two additional
sub-directives:

* ``skip``: How many elements to skip from the beginning (default: 0).
* ``maxitems``: How many elements to return at most (default: no limit).

For example, if the page has multiple elements, but you only want to select the second and third matching element (skip
the first, and return at most two elements), you can use this filter:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/css-skip-maxitems.html
   filters:
     - css:
         selector: div.cpu
         skip: 1
         maxitems: 2

Duplicated results
``````````````````
If you get multiple results from one page, but you only expected one (e.g. because the page contains both a mobile and
desktop version in the same HTML document, and shows/hides one via CSS depending on the viewport size), you can use
``maxitems: 1`` to only return the first item.

Fixing list reorderings with CSS Selector or XPath filters
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
In some cases, the ordering of items on a webpage might change regularly without the actual content changing. By
default, this would show up in the diff output as an element being removed from one part of the page and inserted in
another part of the page.

In cases where the order of items doesn't matter, it's possible to sort matched items lexicographically to avoid
spurious reports when only the ordering of items changes on the page.

The subfilter for ``css`` and ``xpath`` filters is ``sort``, and can be ``true`` or ``false`` (the default):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/items-random-order.html
   filters:
     - css:
         selector: span.item
         sort: true


Optional directives
```````````````````
* ``selector`` (for css) or ``path`` (for xpath) [can be entered as the value of the ``xpath`` or ``css`` directive].
* ``method``: Either of ``html`` (default) or ``xml``.
* ``namespaces`` Mapping of XML namespaces for matching.
* ``exclude``: Elements to remove from the final result.
* ``skip``: Number of elements to skip from the beginning (default: 0).
* ``maxitems``: Maximum number of items to return (default: all).
* ``sort``: Sort elements lexographically (boolean) (default: false).


.. _csv2text:

csv2text
--------
The filter **csv2text** turns *tabular data* formatted as comma separated values (CSV) into a prettier textual
representation. This is done by supplying a Python `format string
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`__ where the csv data is replaced into. If the CSV
has a header, the format string should use the header names (**lowercased**).

For example, given the following csv data::

   Name,Company
   Smith,Apple
   Doe,Google

we can make it more readable by using:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/data.csv
   filters:
     - csv2text:
        format_message: Mr. or Ms. {name} works at {company}.  # note the lowercase in the replacement_fields
        has_header: true

to produce::

  Mr. or Ms. Smith works at Apple.
  Mr. or Ms. Doe works at Google.

If there is no header row, or ``ignore_header`` is set to true, you will need to use the numeric array notation: ``Mr.
or Mrs. {0} works at {1}.``.

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``format_message`` (default): The Python `format string
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#format-string-syntax>`__ containing "replacement fields" into which the
  data from the csv is substituted. Field names are the column headers (in lowercase) if the data has column headers or
  numeric starting from 0 if the data has no column headers or ``ignore_header`` is set to true.
* ``has_header`` (true/false): Specifies whether the first row is a series of column headers (default: use the
  rough heuristics provided by Python's `csv.Sniffer.has_header
  <https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.Sniffer>`__ method.
* ``ignore_header`` (true/false): If set to true, it will parse the format_message as having numeric replacement fields
  even if the data has column headers (or ``has_header``, immediately above, is set to true).



.. _delete_lines_containing:

delete_lines_containing
-----------------------
This filter is the inverse of ``keep_lines_containing`` above and discards all lines that contain the text specified
(default) or match the Python `regular expression
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__, keeping the others.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "eliminate lines that contain 'xyz'"
   url: https://example.com/delete_lines_containing.txt
   filters:
     - delete_lines_containing: 'xyz'


.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "eliminate lines that start with 'warning' irrespective of its case (e.g. Warning, Warning, warning, etc.)"
   url: https://example.com/delete_lines_containing_re.txt
   filters:
     - delete_lines_containing:
         re: '(?i)^warning'

Notes: in regex, ``(?i)`` is the inline flag for `case-insensitive matching
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.I>`__ and ``^`` (caret) matches the `start of the string
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__.

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``text``: (default) Match the text provided.
* ``re``: Match the the Python `regular
  expression <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ provided.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   Renamed from ``grepi`` to avoid confusion.



.. _element-by-…:

element-by-[class|id|style|tag]
-------------------------------
The filters **element-by-class**, **element-by-id**, **element-by-style**, and **element-by-tag** allow you to select
all matching instances of a given HTML element.

Examples:

To extract only the ``<body>`` of a page:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/bodytag.html
   filters:
     - element-by-tag: body


To extract ``<div id="something">.../<div>`` from a page:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/idtest.html
   filters:
     - element-by-id: something

Since you can chain filters, use this to extract an element within another element:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/idtest_2.html
   filters:
     - element-by-id: outer_container
     - element-by-id: something_inside

To make the output human-friendly you can chain html2text on the result:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/id2text.html
   filters:
     - element-by-id: something
     - html2text:


To extract ``<div style="something">.../<div>`` from a page:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/styletest.html
   filters:
     - element-by-style: something



.. _execute:

execute
---------
The data to be filtered is passed as the input to a command to be run, and the output from the command is used in
:program:`webchanges`'s next step. All environment variables are preserved and the following ones added:

+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Environment variable        | Description                                                             |
+=============================+=========================================================================+
| ``WEBCHANGES_JOB_JSON``     | All job parameters in JSON format                                       |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WEBCHANGES_JOB_LOCATION`` | Value of either ``url`` or ``command``                                  |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WEBCHANGES_JOB_NAME``     | Name of the job                                                         |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``WEBCHANGES_JOB_NUMBER``   | The job's index number                                                  |
+-----------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For example, we can execute a Python script:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Test execute filter
   url: https://example.net/execute.html
   filters:
     # For multiline YAML, quote the string and unindent its continuation. A space is added at the end
     # of each line. Pay attention to escaping!
     - execute: "python -c \"import os, sys;
     print(f\\\"The data is '{sys.stdin.read()}'\\nThe job location is
     '{os.getenv('WEBCHANGES_JOB_LOCATION')}'\\nThe job name is
     '{os.getenv('WEBCHANGES_JOB_NAME')}'\\nThe job number is
     '{os.getenv('WEBCHANGES_JOB_INDEX_NUMBER')}'\\nThe job JSON is
     '{os.getenv('WEBCHANGES_JOB_JSON')}'\\\", end='')\""

Or instead we can call a script we have saved, e.g. ``- execute: python3 myscript.py``.

If the command generates an error, the output of the error will be in the first line, before the traceback.

.. tip:: If running on Windows and are getting ``UnicodeEncodeError``, make sure that you are running Python in UTF-8
   mode as per instructions `here <https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#utf-8-mode>`__.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8
   Added additional WEBCHANGES_JOB_* environment variables.



.. _format-json:

format-json
---------------
This filter serializes the JSON data to a pretty-printed indented string using Python's `json.dumps
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.dumps>`__ (or, if installed, the same function from the `simplejson
<https://simplejson.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html?highlight=dumps#simplejson.dumps>`__ library) with a default
indent level of 4.

If the job directive ``monospace`` is unset, to improve the readability in HTML reports this filter will set it to
``true``. To override, add the directive ``monospace: true`` to the job (see :ref:`here <monospace>`).


Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``indentation`` (integer or string): Either the number of spaces or a string to be used to indent each level with; if
  ``0``, a negative number or ``""`` then no indentation (default: 4, i.e. 4 spaces).
* ``sort_keys`` (true/false): Whether to sort the output of dictionaries by key (default: false).

.. versionadded:: 3.0.1
   ``sort_keys`` sub-directive.

.. versionchanged:: 3.20
   The filter sets the job's ``monospace`` directive to ``true``.



.. _format-xml:

format-xml
----------
This filter deserializes an XML object and reformats it. It uses the `lxml <https://lxml.de>`__ Python package's
etree.tostring `pretty_print <https://lxml.de/apidoc/lxml.etree.html#lxml.etree.tostring>`__ function.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "reformat XML using lxml's etree.tostring"
   url: https://example.com/format_xml.xml
   filters:
     - format-xml:

.. versionadded:: 3.0



.. _hexdump:

hexdump
-----------
This filter displays the contents both in binary and ASCII using the hex dump format.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: Display binary and ASCII test
   command: cat testfile
   filters:
     - hexdump:



.. _html2text:

html2text
-------------
This filter converts HTML (or XML) to Unicode text.

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``method``: One of:

 - ``html2text`` (default): Uses the `html2text <https://pypi.org/project/html2text/>`__ Python package and retains
   some simple formatting from HTML, outputting Markup language with absolute links;
 - ``bs4``: Uses the `Beautiful Soup <https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__ Python package to extract text
   from either HTML or XML;
 - ``strip_tags``: Uses regex to strip tags (HTML or XML).


``html2text``
:::::::::::::
This method is the default (does not need to be specified) and converts HTML into `Markdown
<https://www.markdownguide.org/>`__ using the `html2text <https://pypi.org/project/html2text/>`__ Python package.

.. warning:: As this filter relies on the external ``html2text`` Python package, new `releases
   <https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/releases>`__ of this package may generate text that is formatted slightly
   differently, and, if so, will cause :program:`webchanges` to send a one-off change report.

It is the recommended option to convert all types of HTML into readable text, as it can be displayed (after conversion)
in HTML.

Example configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text.html
    filters:
      - xpath: '//section[@role="main"]'
      - html2text:
          pad_tables: true

.. note:: If the content has tables, adding the sub-directive ``pad_tables: true`` *may* improve readability.

Optional sub-directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* See the optional sub-directives in the html2text Python package's `documentation
  <https://github.com/Alir3z4/html2text/blob/master/docs/usage.md#available-options>`__. The following options are set
  by :program:`webchanges` but can be overridden:

  * ``unicode_snob: true`` to ensure that accented characters are kept as they are;
  * ``body_width: 0`` to ensure that lines aren't chopped up;
  * ``ignore_images: true`` to ignore images (since we're dealing with text);
  * ``single_line_break: true`` to ensure that additional empty lines aren't added between sections;
  * ``wrap_links: false`` to ensure that links are not wrapped (in case body_width is not set to 0) as it's not Markdown
    compatible.


``strip_tags``
::::::::::::::
This filter method is a simple HTML/XML tag stripper based on applying a regular expression-based function. Very fast
but may not yield the prettiest of results.

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text_strip_tags.html
    filters:
      - html2text: strip_tags


``bs4``
:::::::
This filter method extracts visible text from HTML using the `Beautiful Soup
<https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/>`__ Python package, specifically its `get_text(strip=True)
<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#get-text>`__ method.

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text_bs4.html
    filters:
      - xpath: '//section[@role="main"]'
      - html2text:
          method: bs4
          strip: true

Parsers
~~~~~~~
Beautiful Soup supports multiple parsers as documented `here
<https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#installing-a-parser>`__. We default to the use of the
``lxml`` parser as recommended, but you can specify the parser by using the ``parser`` sub-directive:

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text_bs4_html5lib.html
    filters:
      - xpath: '//section[@role="main"]'
      - html2text:
          method: bs4
          parser: html5lib
          strip: true

Extracting text from XML
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This filter can be used to extract text from XML by using the ``xml`` parser as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

    url: https://example.com/html2text_bs4_xml
    filters:
      - html2text:
          method: bs4
          parser: xml

Optional sub-directives
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``parser``: the name of the parser library you want to use as per `documentation
  <https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/#specifying-the-parser-to-use>`__ (default: ``lxml``).
* ``separator``: Strings extracted from the HTML or XML object will be concatenated using this separator (defaults to
  the empty string ``````).
* ``strip`` (true/false): If true, strings will be stripped before being concatenated (defaults to false).

Required packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run jobs with this filter method, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[bs4]


If (and only if) you specify ``parser: html5lib``, then you also need to first install :ref:`additional Python
packages <optional_packages>` as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[bs4,html5lib]


.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   Filter defaults to the use of Python ``html2text`` package.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   Method ``re`` renamed to ``strip_tags``.

.. deprecated:: urlwatch
   Removed method ``lynx`` (external OS-specific dependency).



.. _ical2text:

ical2text
---------
This filter reads an iCalendar document and converts it to easy-to read text.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Make iCal file readable"
   url: https://example.com/cal.ics
   filters:
     - ical2text:

Required packages
`````````````````
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[ical2text]



.. _jq:

jq
--

Linux/macOS ASCII only
``````````````````````

The ``jq`` filter uses the Python bindings for `jq <https://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`__, a lightweight ASCII JSON
processor. It is currently available only for Linux (most flavors) and macOS (no Windows) and does not handle Unicode;
see :ref:`below <filtering_json>` for a cross-platform and Unicode-friendly way of selecting JSON.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/jq-ascii.json
   filters:
      - jq: '.[].title'

Supports aggregations, selections, and the built-in operators like ``length``.

For more information on the operations permitted, see the `jq Manual
<https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Basicfilters>`__.

Required packages
:::::::::::::::::
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[jq]

.. _filtering_json:

Filtering JSON on Windows or containing Unicode and without ``jq``
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````
Python programmers on all OSs can use an advanced technique to select only certain elements of the JSON object; see
:ref:`json_dict`. This method will preserve Unicode characters.



.. _keep_lines_containing:

keep_lines_containing
---------------------
This filter keeps only lines that contain the text specified (default) or match the Python `regular
expression <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ specified, discarding the others.
Note that while this filter emulates Linux's *grep*, it **does not** use the executable *grep*.

Examples:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "convert HTML to text, strip whitespace, and only keep lines that have the sequence ``a,b:`` in them"
   url: https://example.com/keep_lines_containing.html
   filters:
     - html2text:
     - keep_lines_containing: 'a,b:'

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "keep only lines that contain 'error' irrespective of its case (e.g. Error, ERROR, error, etc.)"
   url: https://example.com/keep_lines_containing_re.txt
   filters:
     - keep_lines_containing:
         re: '(?i)error'

Note: in regex ``(?i)`` is the inline flag for `case-insensitive matching
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.I>`__.

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``text`` (default): Match the text provided.
* ``re``: Match the the Python `regular
  expression <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ provided.

.. versionchanged:: 3.0
   Renamed from ``grep`` to avoid confusion.



.. _ocr:

ocr
---
This filter extracts text from images using the `Tesseract OCR engine <https://github.com/tesseract-ocr>`_. Any file
format supported by the `Pillow <https://python-pillow.org>`_ (PIL Fork) Python package is supported.

This filter *must* be the first filter in a chain of filters, since it consumes binary data.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/ocr-test.png
   filters:
     - ocr:
         timeout: 5
         language: eng

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``timeout``: Timeout for the recognition, in seconds (default: 10 seconds).
* ``language``: Text language (e.g. ``fra`` or ``eng+fra``) (default: ``eng``).

Required packages
`````````````````
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[ocr]

In addition, you need to install `Tesseract <https://tesseract-ocr.github.io/tessdoc/Home.html>`__ itself.



.. _pdf2text:

pdf2text
--------
This filter converts a PDF file to plaintext using the `pdftotext
<https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext/blob/master/README.md#pdftotext>`__ Python library, itself based on the `Poppler
<https://poppler.freedesktop.org/>`__ library.

For most uses, we recommend using the filter :ref:`pypdf`, which achieves similar results without having to separately
install OS-specific dependencies (Poppler).

This filter *must* be the first filter in a chain of filters, since it consumes binary data.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-test.pdf
   filters:
     - pdf2text

If the PDF file is password protected, you can specify its password:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-test-password.pdf
   filters:
     - pdf2text:
         password: webchangessecret

By default, pdf2text tries to reproduce the layout of the original document by using spaces. Be aware that these
spaces may change when a document is updated, so you may get reports containing a lot of changes consisting of
nothing but changes in the spacing between the columns; in this case try turning it off with the sub-directive
``physical: false``.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-test-no-physical-layout.pdf
   filters:
     - pdf2text:
         physical: false
   monospace: true

.. tip:: If your reports are in HTML format and the PDF is columnar in nature, try using the job directive
   ``monospace: true`` to improve readability (see :ref:`here <monospace>`).

   .. code-block:: yaml

      url: https://example.net/pdf-test-keep-monospace.pdf
      filters:
        - pdf2text:
      monospace: true

To the opposite, if you don't care about the layout, you might want to strip all additional spaces that might be added
by this filter:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pdf-no-multiple-spaces.pdf
   filters:
     - pdf2text:
     - re.sub:
         pattern: ' +'
         repl: ' '
     - strip:
         splitlines: true


Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``password``: Password for a password-protected PDF file.
* ``physical`` (true/false): If true, page text is output in the order it appears on the page, regardless of columns or
  other layout features (default: true). Only one of ``raw`` and ``physical`` can be set to true.
* ``raw`` (true/false): If true, page text is output in the order it appears in the content stream (default: false).
  Only one of ``raw`` and ``physical`` can be set to true.

.. versionchanged:: 3.8.2
   Added ``physical`` and ``raw`` sub-directives.


Required packages
`````````````````
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>` as
follows:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[pdf2text]

In addition, you need to install any of the OS-specific dependencies of Poppler (see
`website <https://github.com/jalan/pdftotext/blob/master/README.md#os-dependencies>`__).



.. _pretty-xml:

pretty-xml
----------
This filter deserializes an XML object and pretty-prints it. It uses Python's xml.dom.minidom `toprettyxml
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.dom.minidom.html#xml.dom.minidom.Node.toprettyxml>`__ function.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "reformat XML using Python's xml.dom.minidom toprettyxml function"
   url: https://example.com/pretty_xml.xml
   filters:
     - pretty-xml:

.. versionadded:: 3.3



.. _pypdf:

pypdf
--------
This filter converts a PDF file to plaintext using the `pypdf <https://pypi.org/project/pypdf/>`__ Python library.

This filter *must* be the first filter in a chain of filters, since it consumes binary data.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pypdf-test.pdf
   filters:
     - pypdf

If the PDF file is password protected, you can specify its password:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pypdf-test-password.pdf
   filters:
     - pypdf:
         password: webchangessecret

The pypdf library locates all text drawing commands in the order they appear in the PDF's content stream, and then
extracts the text. To extract text in a fixed width format that closely adheres to the rendered layout in the source
PDF (experimental), use the sub-directive ``extraction_mode: layout``:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pypdf-test-layout.pdf
   filters:
     - pypdf:
         extraction_mode: layout


.. tip:: If your reports are in HTML format and the PDF is columnar in nature, try using the job directive
   ``monospace: true`` to improve readability (see :ref:`here <monospace>`).

   .. code-block:: yaml

      url: https://example.net/pypdf-test-monospace.pdf
      filters:
        - pypdf:
            extraction_mode: layout
      monospace: true

If the layout is not a concern, you may want to remove any additional spaces that the filter might have introduced.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/pypdf-no-multiple-spaces.pdf
   filters:
     - pypdf:
     - re.sub:
         pattern: ' +'
         repl: ' '
     - strip:
         splitlines: true


extract text in a fixed width format that closely adheres to the rendered
# layout in the source pdf

.. note::

   Users should be aware that updating the underlying pypdf library may trigger :program:`webchanges` to generate a new
   report, even if the actual content of the PDFs has not changed. This is due to the potential formatting improvements
   introduced by pypdf updates.



Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``password``: Password for a password-protected PDF file (dependency required; see below).
* ``extraction_mode``: set to ``layout`` for `experimental layout mode functionality
  <https://pypdf.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/extract-text.html>`__.

.. versionadded:: 3.16

.. versionchanged:: 3.27
   ``extraction_mode`` sub-directive


Required packages
`````````````````
To run jobs with this filter, you need to first install :ref:`additional Python packages <optional_packages>`. If
you're not using the ``password`` sub-directive, then use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[pypdf]


To run jobs with the ``password`` sub-directive, then use the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --upgrade webchanges[pypdf_crypto]






.. _re.findall:

re.findall
----------
This filter extracts, deletes or replaces non-overlapping text using Python `re.findall
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall>`__ `regular expression
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ operation.

Just specifying a regular expression (regex) or string as the value will extract the match. Patterns can be replaced
with another string using ``pattern`` as the expression and ``repl`` as the replacement, or deleted by setting
``repl`` to an empty string.

All features are described in Python’s re.findall's `documentation
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.findall>`__. The ``pattern`` is first iteratively matched using
`re.finditer <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.finditer>`__ and the ``repl`` value is applied to each
non-overlapping match; if ``repl`` is missing, then group "0" (the entire match) is extracted.

Each match is outputted on its own line.

The following example applies the filter twice:

1. Just specifying a string as the value will include the full match in the output.
2. You can use groups (``()``) and back-reference them with ``\1`` (etc..) to put groups into the replacement string.

By default, the full match will be included in the output.

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/regex-findall.html
   filters:
       - re.findall: '<span class="price">.*</span>'
       - re.findall:
           pattern: 'Price: \$([0-9]+)'
           repl: '\1'

.. tip:: Remember that some useful Python regex flags, such as
   `IGNORECASE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.IGNORECASE>`__,
   `MULTILINE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE>`__,
   `DOTALL <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.DOTALL>`__, and
   `VERBOSE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE>`__,
   can be specified as inline flags and therefore can be used with :program:`webchanges`.

You can use the entire range of Python's `regular expression (regex) syntax
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__, and you can ask your favorite Generative AI
chatbot for help. Some examples:

To extract the first line:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/regex-firstline.html
   command: python -c "[print(f'line {n}') for n in range(1, 3)]"
   filters:
     - re.findall: '^.*'


To extract the last line, we use the inline `MULTILINE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE>`__
flag (``(?m)``) and look for a line (``^.*$)``) that is not followed (`negative lookahead assertion
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE:~:text=negative%20lookahead%20assertion>`__) by a newline
plus additional text (``(?!\n.+)``):

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/regex-lastline.html
   command: python -c "[print(f'line {n}') for n in range(0, 3)]"
   filters:
     - re.findall: '(?m)(^.*$)(?!\n.+)'

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``pattern``: Regular expression pattern or string for matching; this sub-directive must be specified when
  using the ``repl`` sub-directive, otherwise the pattern can be specified as the value of ``re.sub`` (in which case
  a match will be extracted).
* ``repl``: The string applied iteratively to each match (default: '\g<0>', or extract all matches).

.. versionadded:: 3.20



.. _re.sub:

re.sub
------
This filter deletes or replaces text using Python Python `re.sub
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>`__ `regular expression
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__ operation.

Just specifying a regular expression (regex) or string as the value will remove the match. Patterns can be replaced
with another string by specifying ``repl`` as the replacement.

All features are described in Python’s re.sub's `documentation <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.sub>`__.
The ``pattern`` and ``repl`` values are passed to this function as-is; if ``repl`` is missing, then it's considered
to be an empty string, and this filter deletes the the leftmost non-overlapping occurrences of ``pattern``.

.. tip:: Remember that some useful Python regex flags, such as
   `IGNORECASE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.IGNORECASE>`__,
   `MULTILINE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.MULTILINE>`__,
   `DOTALL <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.DOTALL>`__, and
   `VERBOSE <https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#re.VERBOSE>`__,
   can be specified as inline flags and therefore can be used with :program:`webchanges`.

The following example applies the filter 3 times:

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Strip href and change a few tags"
   url: https://example.com/re_sub.html
   filters:
     - re.sub: '\s*href="[^"]*"'
     - re.sub:
         pattern: '<h1>'
         repl: 'HEADING 1: '
     - re.sub:
         pattern: '</([^>]*)>'
         repl: '<END OF TAG \1>'

You can use the entire range of Python's `regular expression (regex) syntax
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax>`__: for example groups (``()``) in the ``pattern``
and ``\1`` (etc.) to refer to these groups in the ``repl`` as in the example below, which replaces the number of
milliseconds (which may vary each time you check this page and generate a change report) with an X (which therefore
never changes):

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Replace a changing number in a sentence with an X"
   url: https://example.com/re_sub_group.html
   filters:
     - html2text:
     - re.sub:
         pattern: '(Page generated in )([0-9.])*( milliseconds.)'
         repl: '\1X\3'

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``pattern``: Regular expression pattern or string to match for replacement; this sub-directive must be specified when
  using the ``repl`` sub-directive, otherwise the pattern can be specified as the value of ``re.sub`` (in which case
  a match will be deleted).
* ``repl``: The string for replacement (default: empty string, i.e. deletes the string matched in ``pattern``).



.. _remove_repeated:

remove_repeated
---------------
This filter compares adjacent items (lines), and the second and succeeding copies of repeated items (lines) are
removed. Repeated items (lines) must be adjacent in order to be found. Works similarly to Unix's ``uniq``.

By default, it acts over adjacent lines. Three lines consisting of ``dog`` - ``dog`` - ``cat`` will be turned into
``dog`` - ``cat``, while ``dog`` - ``cat`` - ``dog`` will stay the same

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/remove-repeated.txt
   filters:
     - remove_repeated

This behavior can be changed by using an optional ``separator`` string argument. Also, ``ignore_case`` will tell it to
ignore differences in case and of leading and/or trailing whitespace when comparing. For example, the below will turn
mixed-case items separated by a pipe (``|``) ``a|b|B |c`` into ``a|b|c``:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/remove-repeated-separator.txt
   filters:
     - remove_repeated:
         separator: '|'
         ignore_case: true

Prepend it with :ref:`sort` to capture globally unique lines, e.g. to turn ``dog`` - ``cat`` - ``dog`` to ``cat`` -
``dog``:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/remove-repeated-sorted.txt
   filters:
     - sort
     - remove_repeated

Finally, setting the ``adjacent`` sub-directive to false will cause all duplicates to be removed, even if not
adjacent. For example, the below will turn items separated by a pipe (``|``) ``a|b|a|c`` into ``a|b|c``:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/remove-repeated-non-adjacent.txt
   filters:
     - remove_repeated:
         separator: '|'
         adjacent: false

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``separator`` (default): The string used to separate items whose order is to be reversed (default: ``\n``, i.e.
  line-based); it can also be specified inline as the value of ``remove_repeated``.
* ``ignore_case``: Ignore differences in case and of leading and/or trailing whitespace when comparing (true/false)
  (default: false).
* ``adjacent``: Remove only adjacent lines or items (true/false) (default: true).

.. versionadded:: 3.8

.. versionchanged:: 3.13
   Added ``adjacent`` sub-directive.



.. _reverse:

reverse
-------

This filter reverses the order of items (lines) without sorting:

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.com/reverse-lines.txt
   filters:
     - reverse

This behavior can be changed by using an optional ``separator`` string argument (e.g. items separated by a pipe (``|``)
symbol, as in ``1|4|2|3``, which would be reversed to ``3|2|4|1``):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/reverse-separator.txt
   filters:
     - reverse: '|'

Alternatively, the filter can be specified more verbose with a dict. In this example ``"\n\n"`` is used to separate
paragraphs (items that are separated by an empty line):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/reverse-paragraphs.txt
   filters:
     - reverse:
         separator: "\n\n"


Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``separator``: The string used to separate items whose order is to be reversed (default: ``\n``, i.e. line-based
  reversing); it can also be specified inline as the value of ``reverse``.



.. _sha1sum:

sha1sum
-----------
This filter calculates a SHA-1 hash for the contents. Useful to be notified when anything has changed without
any detail and avoiding saving large snapshots of data.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Calculate SHA-1 hash"
   url: https://example.com/sha.html
   filters:
     - sha1sum:



.. _shellpipe:

shellpipe
---------
This filter works like :ref:`execute`, except that an intermediate shell process is spawned to run the command. This
is to allow for certain corner situations (e.g. relying on variables, glob patterns, and other special shell features in
the command) that the ``execute`` filter cannot handle.

.. danger::
   The execution of a shell command opens up all sort of security issues and the use of this filter should be avoided
   in favor of the :ref:`execute` filter.

Example:

.. code-block:: yaml

   url: https://example.net/shellpipe.html
   filters:
     - shellpipe: echo TEST

.. important:: On Linux and macOS systems, due to security reasons the ``shellpipe`` filter will not run unless **both**
   the jobs file **and** the directory it is located in are **owned** and **writeable** by **only** the user who is
   running the job (and not by its group or by other users) or by the root user. To set this up:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd ~/.config/webchanges  # could be different
      sudo chown $USER:$(id -g -n) . *.yaml
      sudo chmod go-w . *.yaml

   * ``sudo`` may or may not be required;
   * If making the change from a different account than the one you run :program:`webchanges` from, replace
     ``$USER:$(id -g -n)`` with the username:group of the account running :program:`webchanges`.

.. tip:: If running on Windows and are getting ``UnicodeEncodeError``, make sure that you are running Python in UTF-8
   mode as per instructions `here <https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#utf-8-mode>`__.



.. _sort:

sort
----
This filter performs a line-based sorting, ignoring cases (i.e. case folding as per Python's `implementation
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold>`__).

If the source provides data in random order, you should sort it before the comparison in order to avoid diffing based
only on changes in the sequence.

.. code-block:: yaml

   name: "Sorting lines test"
   url: https://example.net/sorting.txt
   filters:
     - sort

The sort filter takes an optional ``separator`` parameter that defines the item separator (by default sorting is
line-based), for example to sort text paragraphs (text separated by an empty line):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/paragraphs.txt
   filters:
     - sort:
         separator: "\n\n"

This can be combined with a boolean ``reverse`` option, which is useful for sorting and reversing with the same
separator (using ``%`` as separator, this would turn ``3%2%4%1`` into ``4%3%2%1``):

.. code:: yaml

   url: https://example.org/sort-reverse-percent.txt
   filters:
     - sort:
         separator: '%'
         reverse: true

Optional sub-directives
```````````````````````
* ``separator`` (default): The string used to separate items to be sorted (default: ``\n``, i.e. line-based sorting).
* ``reverse`` (true/false): Whether the sorting direction is reversed (default: false).



.. _strip:

* ``side``: For one-sided removal: either ``left`` (strip only leading whitespace or matching characters)
  or ``right`` (strip only trailing whitespace or matching characters).
* ``splitlines`` (true/false): Apply the filter on each line of text (default: false, apply to the entire data as a
  block).
