# Configuration for pre-commit (see https://pre-commit.com/)
# A framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks.

# List of hooks at https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html

# Prefer using local configurations as they don't have to be constantly auto-updated (slow).
# Local configuration follows the repo's .pre-commit-hooks.yaml

# Requires the pre-commit package manager to be installed: pip install pre-commit
# To install pre-commit into your git hooks (i.e. at .git/hooks/pre-commit), run 'pre-commit install'.
# To update hooks to the latest version automatically, run 'pre-commit autoupdate'. By default, this will bring the
# hooks to the latest tag on the default branch.

# NOTE: in this package tox runs 'pre-commit run -a'

minimum_pre_commit_version: 3.7.1  # based on what's available at https://pre-commit.ci/

# Force all unspecified python hooks to run python3
default_language_version:
    python: python3
