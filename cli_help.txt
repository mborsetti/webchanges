                  [JOB(S) ...]

Checks web content, including images, to detect any changes since the prior
run. If any are found, it summarizes (including with Gen AI) what changed
('diff') and displays it and/or sends it via email and/or other supported
services. Can check the output of local commands as well.

positional arguments:
  JOB(S)                JOB(S) to run (index number(s) as per --list; if one
                        also URL/command) (default: run all jobs)

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -V, --version         show program's version number and exit
  -v, --verbose         show logging output; use -vv for maximum verbosity
  --log-file FILE       send log to FILE

  --jobs, --urls FILE   read job list (URLs/commands) from FILE or files
                        matching a glob pattern
  --config FILE         read configuration from FILE
  --hooks FILE          use FILE or files matching a glob pattern as hooks.py
                        module to import
  --database, --cache FILE
                        use FILE as snapshots database; FILE can be a redis

                        test a JOB (by index or URL/command) and show filtered
                        output; if no JOB, check syntax of config and jobs
                        file(s)
  --no-headless         turn off browser headless mode (for jobs using a

  --test-differ, --test-diff, --test-diff-filter JOB [JOB ...]
                        show diff(s) using existing saved snapshots of a JOB
                        (by index or URL/command)
