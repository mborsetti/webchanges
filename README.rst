webchanges |downloads|
======================

**webchanges** *anonymously* checks web content (including images) and commands for changes, delivering instant
notifications and AI-powered summaries to your favorite `platform
<https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html#reporters-list>`__.


Requirements
============
**webchanges** requires |support|.

For the best experience, use the current version of `Python <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__. We also support
older Python versions for 3 years after they're replaced by a newer one; we just ask that you use the most up-to-date
bug and security fix release from that older version.

For Generative AI summaries (BETA), you need a free `API Key from Google Cloud AI Studio
<https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey>`__ (see `here
<https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/differs.html#ai-google>`__).


Installation
============
Install **webchanges** |pypi_version| |format| |status| |security| with:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install webchanges

Running in Docker
-----------------
**webchanges** can easily run in a container; you can find a `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`__ implementation
`here <https://github.com/yubiuser/webchanges-docker>`__.


Documentation |readthedocs|
===========================
The documentation is hosted on `Read the Docs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__.


Quick Start
============
Initialize
----------

#. Run the following command to create the default ``config.yaml`` (configuration) and ``jobs.yaml`` (jobs) files and
   open an editor to add your `jobs <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/jobs.html>`__:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit

#. Run the following command to change the default `configuration
   <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuration.html>`__, e.g. to receive change notifications
   ("`reports <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html>`__")
   by `email <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reporters.html#smtp>`__ and/or one of many other methods:

   .. code-block:: bash

      webchanges --edit-config

Run
---
To check the sources in your jobs and report on (e.g. display or via email) any changes found from the last time the
program ran, just run:

.. code-block:: bash

   webchanges


Schedule
--------
**webchanges** leverages the power of a system scheduler:

- On Linux you can use cron, and a tool like `crontab.guru <https://crontab.guru>`__ can build a
  schedule expression for you (note: see `here <https://www.computerhope.com/unix/ucrontab.htm>`__ if you have never
  used cron before);
- On Windows you can use `Windows Task Scheduler <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Task_Scheduler>`__;
- On macOS you can use `launchd <https://developer.apple
  .com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPSystemStartup/Chapters/ScheduledJobs.html>`__ (note: see `here
  <https://launchd.info/>`__ if you have never used launchd before).

Compatibility with and improvements from **urlwatch**
=====================================================

This project is based on code from `urlwatch 2.21
<https://github.com/thp/urlwatch/tree/346b25914b0418342ffe2fb0529bed702fddc01f>`__ dated 30 July 2020.

You can easily upgrade to **webchanges** from the current version of **urlwatch** using the same job and
configuration files (see `here <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/upgrading.html>`__) and benefit from many
improvements, including:

* :underline:`AI-Powered Summaries`: Summary of changes in plain text using generative AI, useful for long documents
  (e.g. legal);
* :underline:`Image Change Detection`: Monitor changes to images and receive notifications with an image highlighting
  the differences;
* :underline:`Structured Data Monitoring`: Track changes in JSON or XML data on an element-by-element basis;
* :underline:`Improved Documentation`: We've revamped the `documentation <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/>`__ to make
  implementation easier;
* :underline:`Enhanced HTML Reports`: HTML reports are now much clearer and include:

  * Clickable links!
  * Retention of most original formatting (**bolding / headers**, *italics*, :underline:`underlining`, lists with
    bullets (â€¢), and indentation;
  * :additions:`added` and :deletions:`deleted` lines clearly highlighted with color and strikethrough;
  * Wrapping of long lines (instead of truncation);
  * Improved compatibility with a wider range of HTML email clients, including those that override stylesheets (e.g.,
    Gmail);
  * General legibility improvements.

* :underline:`New Filtering Options`: New filters, like `additions_only
  <https://webchanges.readthedocs.io/en/stable/diff_filters.html#additions-only>`__, which allows you to focus on
  added content without the distraction of deletions;
* :underline:`New Command Line Arguments`: New command-line arguments such as ``--errors``, which helps you identify
  jobs that are no longer functioning correctly;
* :underline:`Increased Reliability and Stability`: Testing coverage has increased by approximately 30 percentage
  points;
* :underline:`Additional Enhancements`: Numerous other additions, refinements, and bug fixes have been implemented.
